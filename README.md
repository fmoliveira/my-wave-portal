# My Wave Portal

Send me a hello through the blockchain!

This is my project for the course [Build a Web3 App with Solidity + Ethereum Smart Contracts](https://buildspace.so/solidity) at [Buildspace](https://buildspace.so/).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v14+
- MetaMask browser extension

## Getting started

Follow the steps below to run the project locally:

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- List test accounts from your local hardhat node: `npx hardhat accounts`
- Compile smart contracts: `npx hardhat compile`
- Run unit tests: `npx hardhat test`

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
